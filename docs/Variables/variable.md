# Variables

* Variables are names of memory locations where the required data is stored.
* Every Variable has two parts a unique identifier ( name of variable ) and value given to that identifier.

!!! note
    We can use same names for variables in different scopes

```Cpp
#inlcude <iostream>
int main(){
    int i=0;
    // i is variable.
}
```
